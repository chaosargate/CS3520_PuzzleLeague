# CS3520_PuzzleLeague
A clone of the game 'Puzzle League' developed as the semester project for a C++ development course. Worked on by Aaron Hoang and Fiona Hasanaj.

The project was developed using the SFML graphics library as opposed to the course-recommended SDL2 library as we felt the SFML library was easier to work with and it had keyboard event handling built in, which we quite liked.

The graphics come directly from either the SNES "Tetris Attack" or the N64 "Pokemon Puzzle League" and are used for non-profit purposes.

Implementation is loosely based on the rules of actual Puzzle League games; some minor differences include our clone stopping as soon as the stack of blocks touches the top of the play area and our clone's scoring system merely keeping track of how many blocks have been cleared.
